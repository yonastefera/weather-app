# Weather App

This app is built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. The weather data is pulled from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

There are 2 pages: the app page (/) and the "About" page (/about). These pages contain hyperlinks that handle navigation between themselves.

## Running the app

- In the root directory, run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
